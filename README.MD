# React Serverside Rendering Seed.

>> React serverside rendering seed. Powered by Express and Webpack.

Clone this repo and do an `npm install`.

Start the app with one of the following commands:
```javascript
npm start
// OR
npm run production
```

Before running production, make sure you run an `npm run build` first to let
webpack build some production assets.

### TODO
- [ ] Add React Router example
- [ ] Add Reflux example
- [ ] Better nodemon/server reloading of the compiled app on the server
- [ ] Flesh out this readme with a better explanation of the different parts
